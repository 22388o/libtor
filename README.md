# libtor

`libtor` is a Rust crate bundles inside a fully-running Tor daemon, while exposing a nicer interface to operate it compared to the bare-bones version, [libtor-sys](https://crates.io/crates/libtor-sys).

`libtor` makes it easier for projects on multiple platforms to use Tor without depending on the user to configure complex proxy settings from other external software.
